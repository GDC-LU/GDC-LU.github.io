  <h2>L&euml;tzebuerger Kannerduerf - 31 May 2015</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    SOS-KANNERDUERF Lëtzebuerg was founded in 1968: Our work focuses on children whose parents, for various reasons, are no longer able to care for them. We also provide assistance for children and parents who find themselves in difficult family situations.

        <strong>
          Who we are and what we do:
        </strong>
        We are convinced that children are only able to fulfill their full potential when they are able to grow up in the protective surroundings offered by a family environment. We offer this very opportunity to children in the SOS-Kinderdorf families at SOS-Kannerduerf Miersch.
      </p>
      <p>
        In total, we take care of 100 children and young adults day and night, both in SOS-Kinderdorf-families, as well as in child/youth living communities. Additionally, we assist around 200 children/families through a range of non-residential projects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Animal-assisted education draws on the positive, healing effects of human-animal relationships
          </li>
          <li>
            In our preparatory training for working and living we offer young adults practically orientated training designed to ease their transition into working life
          </li>
          <li>
            Antenne Familiale: Non-residential family assistance and a service for foster families which offers both families and children professional support and advice on „living together through love and care“
          </li>
          <li>
            Supervised living at Slemo (service de logement en milieu ouvert) supports young adults at SOS-Kannerduerf Lëtzebuerg on their journey towards independent living.
