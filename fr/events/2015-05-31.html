      Who we are and what we do:
    </strong>
    We are convinced that children are only able to fulfill their full potential when they are able to grow up in the protective surroundings offered by a family environment. We offer this very opportunity to children in the SOS-Kinderdorf families at SOS-Kannerduerf Miersch.
